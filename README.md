The web frontend for a store where you can convert your chatroom karma

To run the app in development, you need to do the following:

```sh
# inside the karma-shop repo
$ gem install sass # for scss
$ npm install -g lineman
$ npm install -g bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

Alternatively, you can run

```sh
$ bin/bootstrap
```

Now that all this in installed, you can run

```sh
$ lineman run
```

This will start the app on `localhost:8000`.
